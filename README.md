# Material UI Boilerplate using webpack
##### This boilerplate is stripped from an app I am working on. There seems to be a lot of difficulty setting up a React Front-end with Material-UI and Webpack. Hopefully this should speed up the production time for you!

# Set Up

`npm install`
then
`npm run dev`

in browser, go to `localhost:8080` or `localhost` if you have NginX set up that way.

# Todo

* Create examples for README
* Remove any unnecessary packages from `package.json`
* Fix whatever else needs to be fixed
